Emotion-based music system with recommendations.
The goal is to fetch user camera, detect emotion, run through data processing and detect the human emotion in real-time and suggest the various list of playlist to the user's as per their specific need.
basic frontend of the application is done using html, css, bootstrap.
now the hard part is remaining. 
hard part is
        get into data processing and machine intelligence to detect human emotions accurately at real time.
        get into API, learn spotify API, learn about its usecases and conditions and implementing it to our system for musical experience.
        and finally connect all of these things together to make a app that is named FUNKIATS. 

GOOD LUCK!!!
